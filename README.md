# AI-8Puzzle-Solver
Using 4 AI search algorithms to solve 8Puzzle game automatically

Tradional AI Search Problems :
In Artificial Intelligence, Search techniques are universal problem-solving methods.Problem-solving agents in AI mostly used these search strategies or algorithms to solve a specific problem and provide the best result.

in this repo we are implementing some of these algorithms , for example BFS,DFS,A*,Alpha-beta brunning

8 puzzle solver:
An 8 puzzle is a simple game consisting of a 3 x 3 grid (containing 9 squares). One of the squares is empty. The object is to move to squares around into different positions and having the numbers displayed in the "goal state". you can read more about it here : https://www.d.umn.edu/~jrichar4/8puz.html

We are solving this probelm through 3 algorithms BFS,DFS,A*.
